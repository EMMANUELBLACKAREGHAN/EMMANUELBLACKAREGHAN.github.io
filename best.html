            <h3>Solving Best elevator using <span>IoT </span> </h3>  
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Here are some ways an IoT solution could help the company address each objective: <br><br>
                1. Increase customer loyalty:  Installing sensors to track the lift's operation and identify any problems before it get worsen could be one way to accomplish a Customers experiences and loyalty.<br><br>
                2. Improve service maintenance and predictive maintenance: Data about the lift's operation might be gathered via an IoT system, and it could then be analysed to find trends that would point to possible problems. This could make it easier for the business to maintain equipment  and take proactive measures to resolve any problems .<br><br>
                3. Manage spare parts inventory more efficiently: When spare parts are running low, an IoT system might be used to keep an eye on the inventory and automatically place new orders.<br><br>
                4. Improve product design and technician training: All the operation of the lift might be gathered throughout an IoT solution, and the design of subsequent lifts may be enhanced as a result. Additionally, technicians might utilise the data to better understand how the lift operates  any issues that may emerge.<br><br>
                5. Improve uptime and field service efficiency: All the operation real-time functioning of the lift and pinpoint any problems that might be causing downtime. This would increase the lift's overall uptime and field service efficiency by enabling the business to promptly handle any problems and reduce downtime.<br><br>
                6. Allocate scarce service technicians more efficiently: An Internet of Things (IoT) system might be used to track the lift's performance and automatically assign service experts according to the urgency of any problems that may occur. This would make it easier to make sure that the most urgent problems are taken care of first and that the limited number of service technicians are employed effectively.<br><br>
                7. Communicate more effectively with suppliers: Suppliers could receive real-time data on the lift's operation and any potential problems via an Internet of things solution. This would enhance communication and cooperation between the business and its suppliers by assisting them in promptly identifying any problems and provide the assistance required to resolve them. <br><br>
