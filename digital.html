        <h3>Digital<span>isation</span></h3>
        <h2><span>What is a 'fully digital enterprise'?</span> </h2>
        <p>An organisation that heavily integrates digital platforms and technology into all aspects of its business operations, interactions, and procedures is referred to as a "fully digital enterprise". Advanced technologies including cloud computing, big data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and other digital tools are usually used in this. By adopting digital transformation, a completely digital organisation seeks to improve customer experience, efficiency, agility, and innovation.
<br><br>
<h2><span>What are the cyber Security challenges/concerns with a  fully digital enterprise?</span></h2> <p>
1. Data Security: Handling and protecting enormous volumes of digital data is a major task.<br>
It becomes essential to guarantee sensitive information's availability, confidentiality, and integrity. <br><br>

2. Cloud Security: Using cloud services creates new attack vectors, necessitating the implementation of strong cloud security protocols.<br><br>

3. E-commerce Security: A fully digital enterprise often involves the use of IoT devices, which can be vulnerable to cyber attacks if not properly secured.<br><br>
4 .Network Security:<br>
The interconnected nature of digital systems increases the risk of network-based attacks.<br><br>
5 .AI Security:<br>
As AI becomes integral, securing AI models and preventing adversarial attacks is essential.<br><br>
6 .Supply Chain Security:<br>
The digital supply chain can be targeted, leading to disruptions or data breaches.<br><br>
<h2><span>What are the cyber security challenges for a bricks and mortar SME wanting to become a digital enterprise?</span>
</h2><br></p> <p>
Limited Resources:<br>
SMEs may lack the budget and expertise for robust cybersecurity measures.<br>
1. Employee Training:<br>
Employees may not be familiar with digital security practices, making them more susceptible to social engineering attacks.<br>
2. Legacy Systems:<br>
Integrating digital solutions with existing legacy systems can create vulnerabilities.<br>
3. Third-Party Risks: MEs could depend on outside services, which raises more security concerns.<br>
4. Regulatory Compliance: SMEs may find it difficult to comply with regulations for digital security.<br>

<h2><span>Do you agree with the views expressed, especially in light of the 'energy crisis' experienced worldwide in 2022?</span></h2><p>
The energy crisis and digital change have a complicated relationship. Digital technology can, on the one hand, support sustainability and energy efficiency. Energy savings can result from, among other things, smart grids, remote work that cuts down on commuting, and optimised industrial processes. However, there might be a substantial energy cost involved in maintaining data centres and using high-performance computing for artificial intelligence. <br><br>
Organisations must weigh the advantages of digital transformation against appropriate energy use in the context of the current energy crisis. It is imperative that data centres make an effort to employ renewable energy sources and energy-efficient technologies. Long-term sustainability depends on responsible behaviours, which raise recurring concerns about how to balance the environmental impact of digital transformation. This includes taking into account issues related to cybersecurity as well as the more general ethical and environmental elements of adopting new technology.
